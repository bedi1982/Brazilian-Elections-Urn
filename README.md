Brazilian Eletronic Urn written in C++ and Qt.

This project was to create an imitation of the Brazilian Election Urn, the resulted interface, as you can see bellow in the screenshot was very goog, IMHO.
For the voting algorithms it uses C++. 

This algorithm has not any kind of check or realiability, just like the original one.
