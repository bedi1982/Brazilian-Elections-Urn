Brazilian Eletronic Urn written in C++ and Qt.

This is a project to test my skils in creating a Qt user interface, making it look exactly like the Brazilian Electronic Voting Urn, the resulted interface looks very similar.
For the voting algorithms I used C++.

Nothing special is needed to run it, but of cource you need a C compiler to build it and the Qt runtime.
